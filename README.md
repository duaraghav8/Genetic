Genetic Algoithms and Genetic Programming

The application uses Genetic Algorithm to elicit the target word "Evolution" from a set of randomly generated combinations of alphabets (the initial population).

The fitness function is the number of correct alphabets (at correct positions) a particular chromosome has divided by total number of correct alphabets (, i.e., the length of the target word (9)), whole squared.
